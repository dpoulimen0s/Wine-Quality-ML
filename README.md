# Scenario
You have been hired to consult for a winery in Portugal. They produce varieties of their traditional
"Vinho Verde" and would like to understand what really determines their quality, so they can
optimise their production. The two datatests include 4899 and 1600 data points, respectively. Each data point is a set of 12
variables; 11 of these are physicochemical measures, and the last is the perceived quality
(sensory output).

# Task
Your task is to create one or more models to predict quality given all other variables. To achieve
this, you will:
1. Explore each of the two datasets
2. Try and determine which subset of your variables can be most useful for learning
This is in preparation to applying machine learning to create your model.
3. Experiment with one or more machine learning approaches
This creates a predictive model for quality.
4. Evaluate each model using k-fold cross validation 
Report the model's performance on both the training set and test set, using appropriate
metrics for the kind of model chosen.
